# googlepageproject
A small project diving into the basics of html and css. Extremely basic, and my first experience with the two. 
Starting off extremely crude, but I plan to revisit this after I get more practice to polish it up.

Non-technical explanation:

It's a copy of the google homepage, seen here. www.google.com. This is my first time working with HTML and CSS (the languages used to design
the page), and I chose this to be my first project. It isn't complete yet, but I plan to finish it when I am more experienced.

Technical explanation:

I needed a simple project that I could easily start to play around with html and css concepts, as a textbook with no practice is a bit dry.
Being able to actually test different methods of making navigation bars and experimenting was extremely valuable. My goal here wasn't to
push out a perfect copy of the google homepage (alright, maybe in a perfect world) but rather to see changes live and practice pushing html
and css changes. 

This is extremely basic, there's no javascript or frameworks, it's just html and css. I could definitely make it much better by adding more
divs and styling more with css. As of now I feel that I've learned a majority of what I could from this project so I'm moving on to basic
JS, however, I do plan to come back and make this much nicer. I'm not sure "carbon copy google homepage" is exactly an eye catcher on a resume,
but it's good practice.
